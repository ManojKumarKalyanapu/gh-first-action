GitHub Actions Overview: 
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) tool built into GitHub that lets you automate tasks such as testing, building, and deploying your code.

1.Workflows :
A workflow is an automated process defined in a .yml file stored in the .github/workflows/ directory of your repo.
A workflow is triggered by events like push, pull_request, schedule, or workflow_dispatch.

example:

name: Deploy App

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

Key Properties:
name: Optional, descriptive name for your workflow.
on: Defines the trigger (e.g., push, pull_request, etc.).
jobs: Collection of one or more jobs that run as part of the workflow.

2. Jobs
A job is a set of steps executed on the same runner (virtual machine).
Jobs run in parallel by default, unless specified with needs.

example:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step 1
        run: echo "Building..."

Key Properties:
runs-on: The environment (runner) used (ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, etc.).
steps: A sequence of operations the job performs.
needs: Defines job dependencies (used to run jobs sequentially).

3. Steps
A step is a single task that can run a script, use an action, or check out code.
Steps run sequentially within a job.

example:

steps:
  - name: Checkout repository
    uses: actions/checkout@v3

  - name: Run tests
    run: npm test

Step Types:
uses: Run an existing GitHub Action (e.g., actions/checkout).
run: Execute shell commands/scripts.
with: Pass input parameters to the action.
env: Set environment variables.
